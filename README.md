# Script and other related stuff to asses the correlation perfomance and other relates stuff to my ACCV paper

## What is in here?
Scripts that I've used (not maintaining them) to study the correlation between uncertainty measures wrt performance.

Some scripts are dedicated for visualizaions, other for stats.

I've also provided some new attributes to the d17 validation set and also the LVOS validation set.
For the DAVIS version I just added attributes to the 2017 which where not available and complemented them with 3 new additional attributes
Concerining LVOS, I've made them from scratch, as they where never released at the time when I needed them, so this is an unoficial version of them.
Although at the end I did not manage to finish the anaylsis per attributes.
