# Script and other related stuff to assess the correlation performance and other relates stuff to my ACCV paper

## What is in here?
Scripts I've used (though not maintained) to study the correlation between uncertainty measures and performance.

Some scripts are dedicated to visualizations, while others focus on statistics.

> [!TIPS]
> I've also provided some new attributes to the d17 validation set and the LVOS validation set.
> For the DAVIS version, I just added attributes to the 2017, which were not available, and complemented them with 3 new additional attributes
> Concerning LVOS, I've made them from scratch, as they were never released at the time when I needed them, so this is an unofficial version of them.
Although I did not manage to finish the analysis per attributes in the end.


> [!NOTE] 
> I don't plan on maintaining this code base (not at this state)
> Feel free to use any of the code as you seem fit, and don't hesitate to ask questions as issues


Here are some app made with streamlit for this project and accessible under the folder apps
